# Schwab Portfolio Rebalancing Platform

A portfolio management platform built for rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting with Charles Schwab. The system manages equity portfolios through rebalancing groups and "sleeves" - groups of similar securities that can substitute for each other during rebalancing while maintaining wash-sale compliance and optimal tax efficiency.

**What happens automatically:**

- Connect your GitHub account
- Select your new repository
- Netlify creates a Neon PostgreSQL database
- Generates required secrets (BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- Builds and deploys your app
- Sets up automatic deployments on every push

**âœ… FREE TIER** - No credit card required. Uses Netlify's free tier + Neon PostgreSQL.

That's it! Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

### Local Setup (Development)

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm
- [Neon CLI](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/neon-cli) (`neonctl`)

  **Install neonctl:**

  ```bash
  # Using npm
  npm install -g neonctl

  # Or using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
  brew install neonctl

  # Or download directly from GitHub releases
  # https://github.com/neondatabase/neonctl/releases
  ```

  **Verify installation:**

  ```bash
  neonctl --version
  ```

##### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd schwab-rebalancer

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up development environment
pnpm run setup

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

#### Database Setup

This project uses **Neon PostgreSQL** with database branching for safe local development.

##### 1. Authenticate with Neon

```bash
# Login to your Neon account
neonctl auth

# List your projects
neonctl projects list
```

##### 2. Create a Local Development Branch

```bash
# Get your project ID from the list above, then create a branch
neonctl branches create --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --name local
```

This creates an isolated database branch for development that won't affect your production data.

##### 3. Configure Database Connection

After creating the branch, you'll get a connection string. Add it to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Add to .env.local (created by pnpm run setup)
# For local development with your Neon branch:
NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:your_password@ep-your-endpoint.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

##### 4. Push Schema and Seed Data

```bash
# Push database schema to your local branch
pnpm run db:push

# Seed with sample data
pnpm run seed
```

#### Local HTTPS Setup

For local HTTPS setup see the [Local HTTPS Setup Guide](./docs/LOCAL_HTTPS_SETUP.md).

#### Schwab Integration

For full Schwab API integration see the [Schwab Setup Guide](./docs/SCHWAB_SETUP.md).
