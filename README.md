# Schwab Portfolio Rebalancing Platform

A portfolio management platform built for rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting with Charles Schwab. The system manages equity portfolios through rebalancing groups and "sleeves" - groups of similar securities that can substitute for each other during rebalancing while maintaining wash-sale compliance and optimal tax efficiency.

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm or pnpm package manager
- **Charles Schwab Developer Account** (REQUIRED for full functionality)
  - See [SCHWAB_SETUP.md](./SCHWAB_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions
  - **HTTPS is REQUIRED** - Schwab OAuth will not work over HTTP
  - Without Schwab integration, the app will operate in limited demo mode only
- Resend API key (for email notifications, optional)

### 2. Installation & Database Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd schwab-rebalancer

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# üö® FIRST STEP: Generate required application secrets
npm run generate-secrets

# Copy .env.example to .env.local and fill in the generated secrets
cp .env.example .env.local

# Set up Neon PostgreSQL database (automatically configured with Netlify)
# After connecting to Netlify, the database will be automatically configured:
npm run db:push

# Seed database with initial data (S&P 500 securities, etc.)
npm run seed
```

### 3. Local HTTPS Setup (REQUIRED for Schwab integration)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Schwab OAuth requires HTTPS. The application will NOT work with Schwab integration over HTTP.**

Follow the HTTPS setup instructions in `docs/LOCAL_HTTPS_SETUP.md` to:

1. Set up local HTTPS with self-signed certificates
2. Configure your browser to accept the certificates
3. Access the application at `https://127.0.0.1` (NOT http://localhost)

### 4. Schwab API Setup (REQUIRED for Schwab integration)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The application requires Schwab API integration to function properly.**

Follow the instructions in [SCHWAB_SETUP.md](./SCHWAB_SETUP.md) to:

1. Register for a Schwab developer account
2. Create an application with the correct callback URLs (`https://127.0.0.1/schwab/callback`)
3. Obtain your API credentials
4. Configure environment variables

### 5. Local Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
INDIVIDUAL_USE=true
NODE_ENV=development
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key # optional

# Schwab API Credentials (REQUIRED - see SCHWAB_SETUP.md)
SCHWAB_CLIENT_ID=your-schwab-client-id
SCHWAB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-schwab-client-secret

# Application secrets (REQUIRED)
# Generate placeholders with: npm run generate-secrets
CRON_KEY=your-cron-key
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-encryption-key
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-better-auth-secret
```

#### Secrets Setup

**Required before starting the application.** The app uses cryptographically secure secrets for:

- **CRON_KEY**: Protects scheduled worker API endpoints
- **DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY**: Encrypts Schwab API credentials before database storage
- **BETTER_AUTH_SECRET**: Signs user sessions for authentication

**Step-by-step instructions:**

1. **Generate the secrets:**
   ```bash
   npm run generate-secrets
   ```

2. **Copy the output into your `.env.local` file:**
   - The command will display three secret values
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the generated values
   - Copy each secret exactly as shown (including the `KEY_NAME=value` format)

3. **Example `.env.local` file:**
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example and fill in these values:
   CRON_KEY=abc123...xyz789
   DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=def456...uvw012
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=ghi789...rst345

   # Plus other required variables (database, etc.)
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: The `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` encrypts sensitive Schwab API credentials (access tokens and refresh tokens) before storing them in the database. Back up this key securely - losing it means losing access to encrypted API credentials in your database. Use the same encryption key across environments that need to read the same encrypted records.

#### Individual Use Mode

The `INDIVIDUAL_USE` environment variable controls user registration for enhanced security:

- **`INDIVIDUAL_USE=true`** (default): Restricts the application to a single user account. This is the recommended setting for personal deployments as it:
  - Prevents unauthorized user registration after the first account is created
  - Reduces attack surface by limiting access to one user
  - Automatically grants the first user administrator privileges
  - Ideal for self-hosted individual use

- **`INDIVIDUAL_USE=false`**: This app is really designed for single-user deployments so this should RARELY be set to `false`. However, if you need to allow multiple user accounts, set this to `false` so that users can register themselves and you can manage them in the admin panel.

**Note**: The first user created will always receive administrator privileges regardless of this setting.

### 6. Running Locally

```bash
# Start development server with HTTPS (required for Schwab OAuth)
# Access at https://127.0.0.1 (NOT http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Open Drizzle Studio to inspect database
npm run db:studio

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Neon PostgreSQL** (automatically created with Netlify deployment)
- **Netlify account** for hosting
- Environment variables configured (see below)

### 1. Environment Setup

Set up your production environment variables in your deployment platform:

```env
# Neon PostgreSQL (automatically configured by Netlify)
# DATABASE_URL will be automatically set by @netlify/neon extension

# Other required environment variables
# (see .env.example for complete list)
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Netlify (Recommended)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sudowealth/schwab-rebalancer)

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `.output/public`
4. Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard

### 3. Generate Required Secrets

Before deploying, you'll need to generate secure secrets. Use these commands to create cryptographically secure values:

| Secret | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | `openssl rand -base64 32` | JWT signing for authentication |
| `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | `openssl rand -base64 32` | AES-GCM encryption for Schwab API credentials |
| `CRON_KEY` | `openssl rand -base64 32` | Protection for scheduled worker endpoints |

**Example output:**
```bash
$ openssl rand -base64 32
Y120VPXl09bWYvT8Z9lPbQ==
```

**Alternative (easier):** Run `npm run generate-secrets` from your project root to generate all secrets at once.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Store these secrets securely and never commit them to version control.

### 4. Required Environment Variables

Add these to your Netlify environment variables:

```env
# Database (already configured)

# Authentication
# Base URL is auto-detected at runtime from request context
# Falls back to deployment platform detection (Netlify, Railway, Heroku, etc.)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_here

# Schwab API
SCHWAB_CLIENT_ID=your_schwab_client_id
SCHWAB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_schwab_client_secret

# Worker protection / encryption (generate fresh values for production)
CRON_KEY=your_cron_key
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_encryption_key
```

### 5. Generate Production Encryption Key

```bash
# Generate fresh secrets for production
npm run generate-secrets
```

### 6. Optional: Email Configuration

For email notifications, add to your environment variables:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Best Practices**:

- **Always use different encryption keys** for development and production environments
- Generate fresh secrets for production: `npm run generate-secrets`
- Never share keys between environments or commit them to version control
- If migrating data from development to production, you'll need to decrypt with the old key and re-encrypt with the new key

### 7. Set up Production Database

```bash
# For Neon PostgreSQL, the database schema is pushed directly to your Neon instance
# Make sure your production environment variables are set correctly
npm run db:push:prod

# Optionally seed production data (be careful!)
# npm run seed
```

### 8. Deploy to Netlify

Your application will automatically deploy when you push to your main branch on GitHub. The deployment URLs will be:

- **Netlify**: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

Monitor deployment status in your chosen platform's dashboard.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Create an Account**: Register at your deployed application URL
2. **Create Rebalancing Groups**: Set up your first portfolio group
3. **Add Sleeves**: Organize securities into sleeves for tax-efficient management
4. **Configure Allocations**: Set target percentages for each sleeve
5. **Connect Schwab** (optional): Link your brokerage account for live trading

## Core Concepts

### Rebalancing Groups

Portfolio containers that hold multiple accounts and sleeves. Each group has:

- Target allocation percentages
- Risk tolerance settings
- Rebalancing frequency rules
- Performance tracking

### Sleeves

Groups of 2-3 similar securities that can substitute for each other:

- Maintain market exposure during tax-loss harvesting
- Enable wash-sale compliant trading
- Ranked by preference for automatic selection

### Models

Pre-defined allocation templates that can be applied to rebalancing groups:

- Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive presets
- Custom model creation
- Historical backtesting capabilities

## Development Commands

### Core Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes TypeScript check)
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run deploy` - Build and deploy to Netlify (via Git push)

### Code Quality

- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint` - Lint with Biome
- `npm run format` - Format code with Biome
- `npm run check` - Lint + format check (no writes)
- `npm run fix` - Lint + format and apply fixes

### Database Management

- `npm run db:generate` - Generate Drizzle migrations
