## Local Development Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm or pnpm package manager
- **Charles Schwab Developer Account** (REQUIRED for full functionality)
  - See [SCHWAB_SETUP.md](./SCHWAB_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions
  - **HTTPS is REQUIRED** - Schwab OAuth will not work over HTTP
  - Without Schwab integration, the app will operate in limited demo mode only
- Resend API key (for email notifications, optional)

### 2. Installation & Database Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd schwab-rebalancer

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install

# Set up Turso database (see docs/TURSO_SETUP.md for detailed instructions)
# After setting up your Turso database and .env.local file:
npm run test-db
npm run db:push

# Seed database with initial data (S&P 500 securities, etc.)
npm run seed
```

### 3. Local HTTPS Setup (REQUIRED for Schwab integration)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Schwab OAuth requires HTTPS. The application will NOT work with Schwab integration over HTTP.**

Follow the HTTPS setup instructions in `docs/LOCAL_HTTPS_SETUP.md` to:

1. Set up local HTTPS with self-signed certificates
2. Configure your browser to accept the certificates
3. Access the application at `https://127.0.0.1` (NOT http://localhost)

### 4. Schwab API Setup (REQUIRED for Schwab integration)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: The application requires Schwab API integration to function properly.**

Follow the instructions in [SCHWAB_SETUP.md](./SCHWAB_SETUP.md) to:

1. Register for a Schwab developer account
2. Create an application with the correct callback URLs (`https://127.0.0.1/schwab/callback`)
3. Obtain your API credentials
4. Configure environment variables

### 5. Local Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file (the app uses a local SQLite database automatically):

```env
AUTH_BASE_URL=https://127.0.0.1
INDIVIDUAL_USE=true
NODE_ENV=development
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key # optional

# Schwab API Credentials (REQUIRED - see SCHWAB_SETUP.md)
SCHWAB_CLIENT_ID=your-schwab-client-id
SCHWAB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-schwab-client-secret

# Encryption Key for sensitive data (REQUIRED)
# Generate with: npm run generate-key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-encryption-key
```

#### Encryption Setup

The application uses AES-256-GCM encryption to protect sensitive data like API tokens. Generate an encryption key:

```bash
# Generate a secure encryption key
npm run generate-key

# Copy the generated key to your .env.local file
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Back up your encryption key securely. Losing it means losing access to encrypted data in your database.

#### Individual Use Mode

The `INDIVIDUAL_USE` environment variable controls user registration for enhanced security:

- **`INDIVIDUAL_USE=true`** (default): Restricts the application to a single user account. This is the recommended setting for personal deployments as it:
  - Prevents unauthorized user registration after the first account is created
  - Reduces attack surface by limiting access to one user
  - Automatically grants the first user administrator privileges
  - Ideal for self-hosted individual use

- **`INDIVIDUAL_USE=false`**: This app is really designed for single-user deployments so this should RARELY be set to `false`. However, if you need to allow multiple user accounts, set this to `false` so that users can register themselves and you can manage them in the admin panel.

**Note**: The first user created will always receive administrator privileges regardless of this setting.

### 6. Running Locally

```bash
# Start development server with HTTPS (required for Schwab OAuth)
# Access at https://127.0.0.1 (NOT http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Open Drizzle Studio to inspect database
npm run db:studio

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Turso account** (database already created: `schwab-rebalancer-db`)
- **Netlify or Vercel account** for hosting
- Environment variables configured (see below)

### 1. Environment Setup

Set up your production environment variables in your deployment platform:

```env
# Turso Database (already configured)
TURSO_CONNECTION_URL=libsql://schwab-rebalancer-db-dyeoman2.aws-us-west-2.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here

# Other required environment variables
# (see .env.example for complete list)
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

#### Option A: Netlify (Recommended)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=YOUR_REPO_URL)

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `.output/public`
4. Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard

#### Option B: Vercel
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository=YOUR_REPO_URL)

1. Import your project
2. Vercel will auto-detect TanStack Start
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### 3. Required Environment Variables

Add these to your Netlify/Vercel environment variables:

```env
# Database (already configured)
TURSO_CONNECTION_URL=libsql://schwab-rebalancer-db-dyeoman2.aws-us-west-2.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here

# Authentication
AUTH_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret_here

# Schwab API
SCHWAB_CLIENT_ID=your_schwab_client_id
SCHWAB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_schwab_client_secret

# Encryption (generate new key for production)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_encryption_key
```

### 4. Generate Production Encryption Key

```bash
# Generate a fresh encryption key for production
npm run generate-key
```

### 5. Optional: Email Configuration

For email notifications, add to your environment variables:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Best Practices**:

- **Always use different encryption keys** for development and production environments
- Generate a fresh key for production: `npm run generate-key`
- Never share keys between environments or commit them to version control
- If migrating data from development to production, you'll need to decrypt with the old key and re-encrypt with the new key

### 4. Set up Production Database

```bash
# For Turso, the database schema is pushed directly to your Turso instance
# Make sure your production environment variables are set correctly
npm run db:push:prod

# Optionally seed production data (be careful!)
# npm run seed
```

### 6. Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

Your application will automatically deploy when you push to your main branch on GitHub. The deployment URLs will be:

- **Netlify**: `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`
- **Vercel**: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

Monitor deployment status in your chosen platform's dashboard.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Create an Account**: Register at your deployed application URL
2. **Create Rebalancing Groups**: Set up your first portfolio group
3. **Add Sleeves**: Organize securities into sleeves for tax-efficient management
4. **Configure Allocations**: Set target percentages for each sleeve
5. **Connect Schwab** (optional): Link your brokerage account for live trading

## Core Concepts

### Rebalancing Groups

Portfolio containers that hold multiple accounts and sleeves. Each group has:

- Target allocation percentages
- Risk tolerance settings
- Rebalancing frequency rules
- Performance tracking

### Sleeves

Groups of 2-3 similar securities that can substitute for each other:

- Maintain market exposure during tax-loss harvesting
- Enable wash-sale compliant trading
- Ranked by preference for automatic selection

### Models

Pre-defined allocation templates that can be applied to rebalancing groups:

- Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive presets
- Custom model creation
- Historical backtesting capabilities

3. **Testing**: Always test in demo mode before production
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and logging
5. **Documentation**: Update docs for all API and feature changes

### Code Standards

- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and conventions
- Use exported return types from functions over manual type definitions
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI patterns

### Database Migrations

When schema changes are introduced (e.g., adding `user.role` or `audit_log`), apply migrations locally:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

If you are running through Caddy/HTTPS and get auth/session issues, ensure you log in on the same origin and that `AUTH_BASE_URL` matches the origin you are using.
