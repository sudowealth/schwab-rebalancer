# Schwab Portfolio Rebalancing Platform

A portfolio management platform built for rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting with Charles Schwab. The system manages equity portfolios through rebalancing groups and "sleeves" - groups of similar securities that can substitute for each other during rebalancing while maintaining wash-sale compliance and optimal tax efficiency.
